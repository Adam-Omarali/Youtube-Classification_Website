# Youtube-Classification
I used a process similar to sentimiment analysis, to help classify YouTube Videos as productive or unproductive. This project used LSTM and GLoVe for word embeddings and prediction. Given this dataset was made by myself and only included a 1000 rows, it was clear overfitting would occur, as seen by the large difference in validation and train. Increasing the data will have improvements in accuracy. 

Why? There are many problems in the world, we just don't have enough people working on important problems. YouTube has the information needed to educate people, but we have all fallen down that rabbit hole. Using this approach, we can educate people on what they need to know to make an impact.
